# graphql-test

Very first steps with grapql, using [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/).

## Run it

In order to get the GraphQL API GUI client running, execute:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Start the server
npm start
```

Then, navigate to http://localhost:4000
